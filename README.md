## Parser/Writer of a JFIF files

This is a sample (but working) code in Go to parse JFIF files into sections
and re-assemble them back.

It was written as a part of my self-driven course to dig into the Go lang.

The test supposes that there are `.jpg` files in your `$TMP/go-basler-pylon-test/`
directory.
